      <h2>About Breast Cancer</h2>
      <p>
        Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. It can occur in both men and women,
        but it is far more common in women.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exact cause of breast cancer is not known, but certain risk factors such as age, family history, and genetic
        mutations can increase the likelihood of developing the disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Symptoms of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, changes in breast size or shape, skin dimpling,
        nipple inversion, or nipple discharge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early detection through regular screening tests such as mammograms can greatly improve the chances of successful
        treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment for breast cancer may involve surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or a
        combination of these.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important for individuals to be aware of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and to seek medical
        attention if any abnormalities are noticed.
